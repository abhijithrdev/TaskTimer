Task Timer App
==============


Setup Instructions
------------------

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/abhijithrdev/TaskTimer.git
cd TaskTimer

2.Install dependencies:
npm install or yarn install

3.Run the app:
expo start


Assumptions made
----------------

1. The app uses React Navigation for routing, so dependencies related to React Navigation are already set up.
2. The app is designed to work on Android devices.


Technical Decisions
-------------------

1. React's useState and useContext is used for state management in this project, as the app doesn’t require complex state handling at this stage.
2. React Native’s built-in StyleSheet is used for styling, which ensures that the app works seamlessly across platforms.
